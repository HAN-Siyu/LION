# LION 0.3.0.0

* Support assigning additional arguments for RNAsubopt and Predator.

# LION 0.2.9.1

* Fix the remaining issue in metric calculation (see explanation in v0.2.9) during the retraining of LION.
Thanks to @Ci-TJ (Qin Lin) for pointing this out.

# LION 0.2.9

* Fix bug in `evaluatePrediction()`: This bug makes the function always take the first level as positive label, yielding wrong values for some metrics (such as sensitivity, specificity, etc) when the first level is negative. This issue made no effect on the results reported in LION's paper. 

# LION 0.2.8

* mtry can be tuned.

# LION 0.2.7

* Update models.

# LION 0.2.6

* Update reference manual.
* Bugs fixed.

# LION 0.2.5

* Update reference manual.
* Bugs fixed.

# LION 0.2.4

* Users can use `run_confidentPrediction()` to get prediction results of multiple methods in one run.
* Update reference manual.
* Bugs fixed.

# LION 0.2.3

* Add `run_LncADeep()` for prediction using LncADeep's feature set.
* Add `computeMLC()` to compute the most-like CDS (MLC) region.
* Add parameter `EDP` which supports applying entropy density profile to sequence intrinsic features.
* Update reference manual.
* Bugs fixed.

# LION 0.2.2

* Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is included into evaluation metrics.
* TP, TN, FP and FN are reported in evaluation results.
* Add `evaluatePrediction()` for prediction evaluation.
* Bugs fixed.

# LION 0.2.1

* Add argument verification.
* Update reference manual.
* Bugs fixed.

# LION 0.2.0

* `"retrain"` and `"feature"` modes are added to function `run_LION()`, `run_RPISeq()`, `run_lncPro()` and `run_rpiCOOL()`. Now users can use ready-to-use functions to extract features or retrain the models of LION, RPISeq, lncPro and rpiCOOL.
* External parallel cores can be passed to functions.
* Internal changes to improve efficiency.
* Update reference manual.
* Bugs fixed.

# LION 0.1.0

* Original release
